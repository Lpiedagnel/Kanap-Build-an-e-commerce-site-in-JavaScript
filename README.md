# Kanap: Build an E-Commerce Website in Javascript

This is a student project for OpenClassrooms Web Developer Path. The goal is to use vanilla Javascript to build the features expected in an E-Commerce (render products, add to cart, modify and delete quantity, verify contact form with RegEx and purchase).

You have to communicate with the Backend API to get and post products.

Warning: this is NOT an official correction by OpenClassrooms. This repo is only my work as a student. I am not responsible for any plagiarism if you use my code to validate the project.


## Installation

1. You have to get and install this repository of OpenClassrooms: https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P5-Dev-Web-Kanap. Don't forget to follow the instructions. This project contains HTML/CSS files and the Back-End API. Without that: the Javascript can't work.

2. In the front Folder: copy/paste the JS folder.

3. You can run the frontend within Localhost (with live server extension of VSC or Laragon/WAMP/MAMP ...)
